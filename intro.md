## Introduction

In this file we are summarizing 4 popular version control workflows: **Centralized, Feature Branch, Gitflow and Forking Workflows**. 

> **Version control** allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track and manage changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

We will start from the most simple strategy and go in steps to more complex strategies. The discussed strategies could be utilized for different projects based on their complexity, structure, and the number of collaborators.

Each workflow has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help teams select the most appropriate one for their needs. By adopting the right workflow, teams can improve their efficiency, reduce conflicts, and ensure a smoother development process.
