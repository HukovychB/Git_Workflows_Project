## Gitflow Workflow

This version control method is a more modern approach to handling large projects in an efficient manner. It involves using different **feature branches** and multiple **primary branches**. Compared to *Feature Branch Workflow* which uses one central branch (e.g. main) this branching strategy allows for more structured and robust way for introducing large updates and patches.
